## Bugs
- None that I know of but I have lied at least once before in my life time.

## TODO
- network multiplayer.
- Show the score after the end of the game.
- Fix that really annoying misalignment of the border of the game board. Trust me it pisses me off more than you.

## Technologies
- Made with javascript, html, css.
- jquery.
- animate.css because aint nobody got time to do that on your own.
