# Project 0: Tic Tac Toe

## How to play
- open the web app version by clicking on the link at the bottom of this README.
- Remember Tick Tac Toe from your younger years
- When the game is over the board will print 'the end' and a score at the bottom
- To play the next round wait until 'the end' is printed and then click anywhere. The board will reset
- the order of the score is win X (or human), win Y (or AI) and draws. 

## Features
- Normal Tic Tac Toe.
- AI Mode.
- Rage Quit button - for if you get tired of drawing (or losing) with the AI.

## Bugs
- None that I know of but I have been wrong before!

## TODO
- network multiplayer.
- Fix that really annoying misalignment of the border of the game board. Trust me it pisses me off more than you.

## Technologies
- Made with javascript, html, css.
- jquery.
- animate.css because aint nobody got time to do that on your own.

## Thank You
- Joel and Rashida for inspiring me every single day.
